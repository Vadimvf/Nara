##Gameplay
The gameplay is meant to mimic Ikagura, a vertical shoot 'em up style video game released in 2001, but with a more 'arcade' feel and stylized graphics. 
> The year is 1985. A textile designer has fallen asleep playing Space Invaders on the Nintendo Entertainment System.
Thanks to the tetris effect and 80's designers' obessions for bright geometric fabrics the dream is dominated by invading 
technicolor textile designs.
